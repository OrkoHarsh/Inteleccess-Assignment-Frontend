Apple Website Clone
Overview
This project is a clone of the Apple website, developed using TypeScript and React. The goal of this project is to showcase the ability to recreate a popular and complex website using modern web development technologies.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

TypeScript: The entire project is written in TypeScript, bringing static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.

React Components: The website is built using React components, making it modular and easy to maintain. Each major section of the Apple website is represented as a reusable component.

Data Fetching: Dynamic content is fetched from APIs to simulate real-world scenarios and demonstrate the ability to handle data asynchronously.

Routing: React Router is used to enable seamless navigation between different pages and sections of the website.

State Management: The project employs state management techniques, such as React's built-in state and context API, to manage the application's state efficiently.
